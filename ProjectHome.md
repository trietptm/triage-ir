Triage: Incident Response automatically collect information from a system that needs basic triage functions performed upon it.  The script allows for easy modification for customization to your needs, in an easy to comprehend and implement language.

This tool uses a lot others to get its information.  Eventually I hope to eliminate the need for them, but use them as verification.

This tool requires you to download the Sysinternals Suite if you want full functionality to it.

Sysinternals available at:  http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb842062
> Place the 'SysinternalsSuite' folder within the tools folder.

(Prior requirements are now included within the download)

This is a work in progress and I make no warranty or guarantee that it will work properly.
